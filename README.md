# Smart-Campus-Assistant
This project presents a graph-based indoor navigation system designed to assist users in navigating large academic campuses. The campus layout is modeled as a directed graph where locations are represented as nodes and walkable paths as edges. Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to compute the shortest path between a source and destination.
